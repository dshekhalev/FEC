Static configuration DVB-S2 LDPC code ETSI EN 302 307 V1.2.1 (2009-08) and DVB-S2X LDPC code DVB BlueBook A083-2 (Feb 2020) 

Support all coderates and codewords.

Encoder has fixed performance engine with variable interface bitwidth. 

Decoder use 2D normalized Min-Sum algorithm with near fixed performance engine, fast decoder syndrome based stop logic, optional 2 types of normalization and self-corrected algorithm.

Attention only decoder with least performance include in repo!!! 

Codec input/core/output work in different clock domains. 

vivado 2019.1 Kintex 7 - 2 (artix worked but has timings routing problem)

Encoder settings : DVB-S2 coderate = 5/6, block length = 64800 bits, interface 8 bits per tick, no internal parity bits transponse

Encoder 	: LUT/REG/RAMB 	3.7k/3.5k/15 	iface >250MHz(1.65Gbps -> 2Gbps), core >250MHz (~25.5Gbps at output) 

Decoder settings : DVB-S2 coderate = 1/2, block length = 64800 bits, 8 LLR/bits per tick, pLLR_W = 4 bits, pNORM_OFFSET = 0, pUSE_SC_MODE = 1, 25 iterations

pNODE_W = 6 bits (optimal codegain for 4 bit LLR)

Decoder 	: LUT/REG/RAMB 	57k/63k/107.5 	iface >250MHz, core >250MHz (480Mbps -> 240Mbps)

pNODE_W = 5 bits (good codegain for 4 bit LLR)

Decoder 	: LUT/REG/RAMB 	49k/56k/97.5 	iface >250MHz, core >250MHz (480Mbps -> 240Mbps)

pNODE_W = 4 bits (worst codegain for 4 bit LLR)

Decoder 	: LUT/REG/RAMB 	41k/49k/87.5 	iface >250MHz, core >250MHz (480Mbps -> 240Mbps)

Attention: The coder and decoder correspond each other but can have different bit order with standard codes. Strongly speaking it's not DVB-S2 codec by default, because there is no parity bits reorder inside. It should be done external of codec during bit interleaving procedure !!!

PS. There is optinal parity bits transpose unit inside encoder? this unit don't have opponent inside decoder. That's why use it only for encoder aplications.
